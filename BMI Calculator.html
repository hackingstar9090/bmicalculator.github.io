    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
	
    <p>The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilogrammes by the square of their height in metres. A high BMI indicates a high level of body fatness. BMI dBMI considers natural differences in body shape to determine a healthy weight range for a given height. When determining if you're a healthy weight, healthcare providers may consider other indicators in addition to your BMI. Because muscle is substantially denser than fat, people who are extremely muscular, such as heavyweight boxers, weight trainers, and sportsmen, may be at a healthy weight while having an obese BMI. Your ethnic background can also influence your chance of developing certain diseases. Adults of South Asian heritage, for example, with a BMI of 23, which is generally considered healthy, may have a higher risk of some health concerns, such as diabetes. If you're pregnant, you shouldn't use BMI as a metric.etects weight categories that may cause health concerns, however it does not diagnose an individual's body fatness or health. If you're worried about your weight, talk to your midwife or doctor.

 <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Accuracy of BMI<h2>
 <hr style="width:250px" class="w3-opacity">
<p>BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a healthy weight range for a particular height.

As well as measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other factors into account when assessing if you're a healthy weight.

Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.

Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health conditions. For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a higher risk of some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI of 23, which is usually considered healthy.

You should not use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice from your midwife or GP if you're concerned about your weight.</p><br>

	 <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Risks associated with being overweight<h2>
 <hr style="width:600px" class="w3-opacity"> <br>
	<a>Being overweight increases the risk of a number of serious diseases and health conditions. Below is a list of said risks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): <br> <br>

1. High blood pressure<br>
2. Higher levels of LDL cholesterol, which is widely considered "bad cholesterol," lower levels of HDL cholesterol, considered to be good cholesterol in moderation, and high levels of triglycerides<br>
3. Type II diabetes<br>
4. Coronary heart disease<br>
5. Stroke<br>
6. Gallbladder disease<br>
7. Osteoarthritis, a type of joint disease caused by breakdown of joint cartilage<br>
8. Sleep apnea and breathing problems<br>
9. Certain cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, liver)<br>
10. Low quality of life<br>
11. Mental illnesses such as clinical depression, anxiety, and others<br>
12. Body pains and difficulty with certain physical functions<br><br>
Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI
As can be seen from the list above, there are numerous negative, in some cases fatal, outcomes that may result from being overweight. Generally, a person should try to maintain a BMI below 25 kg/m2, but ideally should consult their doctor to determine whether or not they need to make any changes to their lifestyle in order to be healthier.</a><br><br>
    	<br>
		 <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Risks associated with being underweight<h2>
 <hr style="width:600px" class="w3-opacity"><br>
 <a>Being underweight has its own associated risks, listed below:<br><br>

1. Malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, anemia (lowered ability to carry blood vessels)<br>
2. Osteoporosis, a disease that causes bone weakness, increasing the risk of breaking a bone<br>
3. A decrease in immune function<br>
4. Growth and development issues, particularly in children and teenagers<br>
5. Possible reproductive issues for women due to hormonal imbalances that can disrupt the menstrual cycle. Underweight women also have a higher chance of miscarriage in the first trimester<br>
6. Potential complications as a result of surgery<br><br>
Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI
In some cases, being underweight can be a sign of some underlying condition or disease such as anorexia nervosa, which has its own risks. Consult your doctor if you think you or someone you know is underweight, particularly if the reason for being underweight does not seem obvious.</a><br>

		<a>We are a group from the RCS2514A class who created a bmi calculator that can help users to measure their bmi more easily without counting manually. Our BMI is a measurement that is a ratio of your weight and height. It’s a good way to gauge whether your weight is in healthy proportion to your height. In fact, knowing your BMI can help you – and your GP – determine any health risks you may face if it’s outside of the healthy range. This BMI Calculator has been built by three of us, namely Amir, Wan and Fikri</a><br>
